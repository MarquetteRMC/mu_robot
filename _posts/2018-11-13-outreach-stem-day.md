On November 13th two members, Matt Braccio and Zach Nordgren, of the Marquette Aerospace and Robotics Systems team presented at Deer Creek Intermediate School to 40 sixth through eighth graders on their STEM careers day about Engineering, Robotics, Space, and NASA. 
The presentations were a hit and the students asked tons of questions about the challenges of colonizing mars. The team members were also able to tour the VEX robotics workshop at the school and see the exciting work that their students and other highschool students are working on.
This event was a blast and it is the hope of the team that we can return next year and forge a relationship with Deer Creek.
