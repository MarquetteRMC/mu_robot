In November, some members of our team visited East Troy Middle School to talk about space exploration, specifically Mars. 
Francesco Fuentes gave an hour long presentation in front of about 60 students, answering all sorts of questions about everything space and Mars. 
Some questions delved into the realm of black holes and stars, but despite the change in topic, each question was given a confident answer. 
In the end, the students groaned about having to leave, but were still happy to have had their curiosity satisfied by our team members' knowledge and passion for space.
