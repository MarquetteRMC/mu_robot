title: We are in the competition!
---

Hello world! Marquette University's RMC team is excited to announce that it has been accepted into the 2019 edition of the NASA Remote Mining Competition that will be held in May. We have a long way to go but we are generating ideas and prototyping up a storm. We are still on the lookout for sponsors and supporters. If you or your organization are interested in helping us out in any way, we would be more than grateful and include you in sponsors list. More info will be coming soon on our sponsor package, but a Christmas card is the least you can expect. Email us at [contact@murobot.net](mailto:contact@murobot.net) and we will get back to you within a business day.

In this blog we will be sharing pictures and technical design updates of the challenges that we will overcome over the next few months. The robot in the end will be fully autonomous and capable of mining 60 centimeters down into the soil.

Once we get official head shots we will be introducing the team and sharing more about our hopes and dreams for this project, and more importantly, how we intend to reach them.

Thank you for your interest and support, we couldn't do this on our own.

Love,
Marquette's RMC Team
