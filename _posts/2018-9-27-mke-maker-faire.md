Thank you [Maker Faire Milwaukee](https://milwaukee.makerfaire.com) for allowing the team to have a Show and Tell booth at the 2018 Maker Faire!

From their website: 
>Maker Faire is a gathering of fascinating, curious people who enjoy learning and who love sharing what they can do. From engineers to artists to scientists to crafters, Maker Faire is a venue for these "makers" to show hobbies, experiments, projects.
We call it the Greatest Show (& Tell) on Earth - a family-friendly showcase of invention, creativity, and resourcefulness.

The event is co-hosted by the [Betty Brinn Children’s Museum](https://www.bbcmkids.org/).
 
It is estimated that just under 40,000 individuals attended this year’s event at the Wisconsin State Fair Park, five miles from Marquette’s campus. We were fortunate enough to be right near the entrance as well!

The team spoke with guests of all ages and discussed the project goal of being able to support In-Situ Resource Utilization on Mars and the role that our robot will play in the process. When speaking with K-12 students we relayed our enthusiasm in the project and encouraged them to seek out their own personal STEM interests.

We showcased a 2017-2018 senior design project named Arnold, an autonomous snowplow robot. This robot is undoubtedly an attention grabber which allowed us to talk to event-goers about Marquette senior design successes and how we intend to continue this trend in the NASA Robotic Mining Competition.
