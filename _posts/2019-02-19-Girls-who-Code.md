The team presented to the introductory class of students for Girls Who Code on the
applications of their class. They used RMC and the robot prototype as an example, showing how
computer programming is an important part of space exploration and robotics. The team
discussed how physical problems the robot would encounter on Mars could be solved using
computer code. Students were able to see the robot up close and learn how the team uses
programming to control the robot. Students asked questions on a range of topics from the robot,
to space exploration, and beyond.
