Golda Meir is a part of the Milwaukee Public School System with a diverse mix of
students (60% black, 23% white, 11% Hispanic). The team judged Golda Meirâ€™s annual science
fair, giving students the opportunity to showcase their projects and answer questions. This
science fair is used by the school as an opportunity for the students to get feedback on their
projects and better prepare them for success at the Wisconsin state science fair. The team asked
the students questions to help clarify their projects and gave written feedback to help with their
preparation for the state science fair.
