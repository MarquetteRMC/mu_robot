The team developed an introductory class for students at the Don & Sallie Davis Center
using LEGO Mindstorms. The goal of this class is to get students who are not normally able, or
interested, participating in the Boys & Girls Clubs robotics offerings. The robotics club at the
Davis Center provides a valuable opportunity for children to engage in practical STEM
applications, which better prepares them for secondary education and sparks interest in STEM at
an early age. The goal of this class is that after being exposed to LEGO Mindstorms and having
experience working with it, the students will be more interested in, and prepared, for
participating in the Boys & Girls Club robotics club. The team created a lesson plan and
organized volunteers to teach the class once per week. The class will continue every Monday for
the rest of the semester and pick up again in Fall 2019.
