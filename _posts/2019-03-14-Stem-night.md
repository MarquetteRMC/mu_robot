The team traveled to Illinois over spring break to put on an evening of fun and learning
for students in the Chicago Heights area. The night included presentations on upcoming Mars
missions, the goal of the RMC, a chance to pilot the teamâ€™s prototype, hands-on physics
demonstrations about gyroscopic forces, and a Q&A panel for parents and students on everything
STEM and college related. The team answered questions from students about the project and the
logistics of colonizing Mars, as well as questions from students and parents on selecting colleges,
the ins and outs of studying engineering, and the importance of research and internship programs
as an undergraduate.

After the event we received the followig feeback from Marian:

The presentation was incredibly important for a few reasons. One is exposure: So many kids do not know what is out there. Kids don’t hear anything about these majors until they get to college. One of my goals as principal was to have opportunities for the kids that have that spark at 14, so they can be inspired to pursue a STEM field and to be prepared for this field at 18. We need kids to go to college knowing the engineering basics so they can hit the ground running.
Second, anytime you put the word NASA on it, that has weight. To 10-year olds who haven’t followed the space industry, that name is recognizable. It’s important for kids to know that space exploration is happening, and they can be a part of it.
Third, the demographics of the evening were important and heartening to see. We had a mix of students from underrepresented areas, and a LOT of girls, from a wide age range. This is the kind of mix we’re striving for in colleges and the workplace. It was fabulous to see that last night. As stated, the earlier we can get students interested the better, and the age range was indicative that the interest is there.
We liked the way the team brought background information in and brought everyone to a level playing field of understanding. The interactive demos brought the kids together and really engaged them.
