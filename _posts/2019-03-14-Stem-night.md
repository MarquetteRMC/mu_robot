The team traveled to Illinois over spring break to put on an evening of fun and learning
for students in the Chicago Heights area. The night included presentations on upcoming Mars
missions, the goal of the RMC, a chance to pilot the team’s prototype, hands-on physics
demonstrations about gyroscopic forces, and a Q&A panel for parents and students on everything
STEM and college related. The team answered questions from students about the project and the
logistics of colonizing Mars, as well as questions from students and parents on selecting colleges,
the ins and outs of studying engineering, and the importance of research and internship programs
as an undergraduate.
